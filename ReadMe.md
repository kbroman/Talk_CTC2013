### Talk: &ldquo;Interactive graphics for high-dimensional genetic data&rdquo;

See it in action [here](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/talks/CTC2013).

These are slides for a talk I gave at the [Complex Trait Community
meeting](http://rqtl.org/ctc2013) in Madison, Wisconsin, on 31 May 2013.

The slides were tested for Safari on a Mac and might look terrible in
some browsers. I have a lot more to learn about handling browser
differences.
